# environmental_mediation_framework

#There are three main scripts in this environmental mediaiton framework based on the approaches in the pipeline: 

#Approach 1a: 1_pairwise_mediation.R

#Approach 1b: 3_exposure_reduction.R

#Approach 2: 2_mediator_shrinkage_reduction.R


#Approach 2 is chiefly focused on a setting where number of mediators is less than total sample size

#If the user has a dataset where the number of mediators are greater than sample size, refer to script: gPVD.R for example code on implementing a preliminary matrix decomposition step prior to high-dimensional mediation analysis
